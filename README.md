#Hack and Slash game

I've stopped game development in order to learn more web development for now. I thought the combat system I designed and coded was pretty cool though so I wanted to keep a record of it.

There are no assets in the project anymore because I deleted them to save space, and money on Github.

This is just a means to save my code because I have fond memories of jumping around and playing with the combat system. :)

HackAndSlashGame\HackAndSlash\Source\HackAndSlash for code.
